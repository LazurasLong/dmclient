Welcome to dmclient!
====================

This document details at a high-level the structure of dmclient's documentation,
which is intended to get you hacking on the source base as quickly as possible.


In-tree and Wiki all as one
===========================

This part of the source tree is mirrored at the publicly available Wiki page [1]_.


Why keep the Wiki in-tree?
==========================

The primary advantage of this system is that non-programmers can edit the docs
and keep them up to date without having to learn how to use git or otherwise go
through the process of having code patches reviewed.

A secondary advantage is that developers can edit the docs in whatever manner
they please: through the Wiki, their favourite command-line text editor, or
through their IDE, etc.
