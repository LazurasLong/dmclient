Welcome to dmclient!
====================

This is still largely under construction, but this is intended to be the
user-facing documentation for dmclient.

In-tree and Wiki all as one
===========================

It is my hope that dmclient's documentation can be synced up with a
publicly-facing wiki powered by `MoinMoin https://moinmo.in/`_, but there are
several problems with this that need to be addressed first...
