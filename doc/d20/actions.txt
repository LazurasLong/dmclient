Noted in events.txt, we talk about the following types of action events:

moving
casting a spell
use ability
use skill
activate item
attacking
equip/de-equip item/weapon

This document classifies the actions listed on [1] into the following
event types, possibly leading to an expansion of the event types in dmclient. A
star (`*') indicates that this action may be required to have custom
functionality per the system involved.

Note: attacks of opportunity can be embedded in the general Action object for
d20. The ability type can be embedded in that object as well (Ex/Su/Sla)
