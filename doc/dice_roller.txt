dmclient's dice roller should feature a "dice expression evaluator"

so we can do things like:
	2d6
	3d8+4d6
which will fill in the appropriate fields on the GUI window (if not a really 
complicated expression - for the above, probably only 2d6 would be filled in)

we should also allow for a graphical display of the PDF and CDF of a given dice
expression (also show mean and stddev)

dice object:
	associated str expression
	mean
	stddev
	an evaluate() function to get the result
	
store/cache dice objects by string name
	i.e. {'2d6':<Dice object '2d6'>, '3d8+4d6':<Dice object '3d8+4d6'>}
